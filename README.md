1. HomePage - 
The homepage that displays as soon as the user opens the application. The user
will be able to enter the location and search for that particular location if there are any
parking spots available.

2. Location Search - 
The Location Search menu is where the user can either choose from the
most searched locations that are provided in the green boxes or the user
could simply choose a location by entering it, that location is thus displayed
on the map below.

3. Parking Space - 
This page is called the Parking Space that comes after the user has entered
the specified location in the previous page. The wide-view of the area is
shown on the map. The red arrows show the possible spots for parking.

4. Payment - 
The final page, the Payment gateway is where the user would confirm their
parking slot and do the payment. Here, the user would first have to select
the arrival date and time followed by the duration. The user would then
have to choose a vehicle type from a dropdown and then select a preferable
payment method. The final amount is thus displayed on the top.
